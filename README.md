# PokemonGodot

My attempt at a recreation of Pokemon Yellow in Godot game engine.
It's quite barebones at the moment. The entire overworld map is complete, but only Pallet town has enterable buildings.
Battles have not been implemented yet either.

Controls:
Z = Accept/Activate
X = Back
Enter = Start/Open Menu

Please let me know if you notice any bugs or issues.
